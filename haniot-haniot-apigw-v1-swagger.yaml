      summary: Authenticate user.
      description: |
        Authenticate a user. User authentication is performed using JWT token generation. In generating the JWT token, there are following types of attributes:
        
        **Reserved Claims**: Non-mandatory (but recommended) attributes used in token validation by API security protocols. These are used to create a pattern and are defined in RFC-7519.
        * sub (subject) - Entity that the token belongs to, usually the user ID;
        * iss (emitter) - sets the emitter of the token;
        * exp (expiration) - Timestamp of when the token will expire;
        * iat (issued at) - Timestamp from when the token was created.
        
        **Public claims**: Attributes that are not part of the pattern, and are defined especially for sharing information between applications.
        
        * scopes - A developer-defined attribute that specifies token access scopes.
        
        Example of values that can compose the payload.:
      
      
        ```json
        {
          "sub": "5accb6215ba48413e81e7853e",

        For filtering with logical operators, just follow the syntax:
        **_property=operator:value_**. The available operators are:
         - **gt** -> Defines which value of the attribute is greater than 
                    (that is,>) the specified value.
         - **gte** -> Defines which attribute value is greater than or equal to
                    (that is,>=) the specified value.
         - **lt** -> Define the value of the attribute to be less than (that is, <)
                    the specified value.
         - **lte** -> Defines which value of the attribute is less than or equal to 
                    (that is, <=) the specified value.

        Example: **_?field1=gte:80&age=lt:100_** to recover the users with age 
        is greater than or equal to 80 and less then 100.

        Define start date in format: YYYY-MM-DD ou YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. The
        attribute used for the query will be the registration_date.

    periodParam:
      in: query

        Sets the period from the available ones:
         - **[1..n]d** - Total days (1d, 2d, ...)
         - **[1..n]w** - Total of weeks (1w, 2w, ...)
         - **[1..n]m** - Total of months (1m, 2m, ...)
         - **[1..n]y** - Total of years (1y, 2y, ...)
        The attribute used for the query will be the registration_date.

        A search is a sub-resource of a collection. As such, your results may have a 
        different format from the collection itself. The sub-resource search works just
        like filtering and its syntax allows to make approximations. The string queries: 
        partial responses, pagination, ordination, filtering e date, must be supported 
        in the search. It is worth noting that not every resource should allow support 
        to queries. The query is not case sensitive, and the available syntax may be:
        
        * property=value* - Search for data that begins with the value provided.
        
        * property=*value - Search for data that ends with the given value.
        
        * property=*value* - Search for data that contains the value provided in any position.
